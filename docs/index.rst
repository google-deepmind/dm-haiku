Haiku Documentation
===================

Haiku is a library built on top of JAX designed to provide simple, composable
abstractions for machine learning research.

.. code-block:: python

    import haiku as hk
    import jax
    import jax.numpy as jnp

    def forward(x):
      mlp = hk.nets.MLP([300, 100, 10])
      return mlp(x)

    forward = hk.transform(forward)

    rng = hk.PRNGSequence(jax.random.PRNGKey(42))
    x = jnp.ones([8, 28 * 28])
    params = forward.init(next(rng), x)
    for _ in range(5):
      logits = forward.apply(params, next(rng), x)

Installation
------------

See https://github.com/jax-ml/jax#pip-installation for instructions on
installing JAX.

We suggest installing the latest version of Haiku by running::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku
    
Alternatively, you can install via PyPI::

    $ pip install -U dm-haiku

Known issues
------------

.. warning::
    Using JAX transformations like :func:`jax.jit` and :func:`jax.remat` inside
    of Haiku networks can lead to hard to interpret tracing errors and
    potentially silently wrong results. Read :doc:`notebooks/transforms` to find
    out how to work around these issues.
